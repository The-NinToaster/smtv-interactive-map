Shin Megami Tensei (真・女神転生), Shin Megami Tensei V (真・女神転生 V) is property of ATLUS and SEGA. Any maps and assets have been taken directly from the NA Distribution of SMTV for the Nintendo Switch, dumped from my own copy of the game.

you know, for as much as atlus is really good at making dungeon crawling and compelling rpgs such as Etryan Oddesey, Shin Megami Tensei and ...Persona i guess, they sure fucking suck at making compelling maps and smtv's maps are probably their biggest crime to cartography
